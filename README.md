The plan for 2 of the three canvas' involves some data visualization. It is our intention for canvas 1 to show an image of an NBA player and a statistic above the image, and a bar would fill up depending on the statistic, check image attached. Also, "good/bad" stats would lead to a different animation of the player's "emotion." For example, a good 3P% would lead to a thumbs up and maybe fire emoji's surrounding the player, and a bad 3P% would yield a thumbs down and ice emoji's surrounding the player image. Canvas 2 will hold a similar template with the NBA player image on the canvas with the labeled statistics, but on hover would lead to the showing of a video based on the hovered statistic (ex: hover on 3P% displays a video of a made 3 pointer). Canvas 3 will be interactive with the webcam, and it is our intention to have the user place their face in the center  and then let there be a "mask" over the face like James Harden's beard as an example. But the user can have the opportunity to change the mask like Stephen Curry/Lebron and their jersey's as well, maybe.
