The plan for 2 of the three canvas' involves some data visualization. It is our intention for canvas 1 to show an image of an NBA player and a statistic above the image, and a bar would fill up depending on the statistic, check image attached. Also, "good/bad" stats would lead to a different animation of the player's "emotion." For example, a good 3P% would lead to a thumbs up and maybe fire emoji's surrounding the player, and a bad 3P% would yield a thumbs down and ice emoji's surrounding the player image. Canvas 2 will hold a similar template with the NBA player image on the canvas with the labeled statistics, but on hover would lead to the showing of a video based on the hovered statistic (ex: hover on 3P% displays a video of a made 3 pointer). Canvas 3 will be interactive with the webcam, and it is our intention to have the user place their face in the center  and then let there be a "mask" over the face like James Harden's beard as an example. But the user can have the opportunity to change the mask like Stephen Curry/Lebron and their jersey's as well, maybe.

Update: 

1st Page:
We have done what we intended to do and created cartoon characters out of three famous players: steph curry, lebron james, and russel westbrook. We have also included reactions in the characters to show how well they are doing. Characters that have great stats will be smiling while characters with worse stats will be frowning.

2nd Page:
Initially we wanted to show some edited videos from the NBA playoffs by using p5.js, however, we didn't think we could show it in a special way. Instead, we decided to show the NBA Playoff bracket to show what's happening currently. We wanted to make a more visual representation on who's winning as well as how they are winning in each game. We made winners knock out the losers.

3rd Page:
We kept the initial idea of placing an image over the webcam and allow the user to take a picture of themselves with a specific team's jersey. The user is able to use buttons to change the team and jersey they want to take a picture of.
